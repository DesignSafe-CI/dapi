Welcome to the **DesignSafe API (dapi)** documentation! 

`dapi` is a Python library that simplifies the process of submitting, running, and monitoring [TAPIS v3](https://tapis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) jobs on [DesignSafe](https://designsafe-ci.org) via [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.designsafe-ci.org). It provides high-level, user-friendly interfaces for working with DesignSafe resources and research databases.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚀 Job Management
- **Simple Job Submission**: Submit computational jobs with minimal configuration
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track job progress with interactive progress bars
- **Output Management**: Easily access and download job results
- **Application Discovery**: Find and explore available DesignSafe applications

### 📊 Database Access
- **Research Databases**: Connect to DesignSafe research databases (NGL, Earthquake Recovery, VP)
- **SQL Queries**: Execute SQL queries and get results as pandas DataFrames
- **Automatic Connection Management**: Handles database connections and credentials

### 📁 File Operations
- **Path Translation**: Convert DesignSafe paths (/MyData, /projects) to TAPIS URIs
- **File Management**: Upload, download, and list files on DesignSafe storage
- **Path Verification**: Validate that paths exist before using them

### 🔐 Authentication & Credentials
- **Simplified Auth**: Easy authentication with DesignSafe credentials
- **Multiple Methods**: Support for environment variables, .env files, and interactive input
- **TMS Credential Management**: Establish, check, and revoke SSH keys on TACC execution systems
- **Secure**: Handles credentials securely with encrypted storage

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

Get started with dapi in just a few lines:

```python
from dapi import DSClient

# Initialize client (handles authentication automatically)
client = DSClient()

# Submit a job
job_request = client.jobs.generate_request(
    app_id="matlab-r2023a",
    input_dir_uri="/MyData/analysis/input/",
    script_filename="run_analysis.m"
)
job = client.jobs.submit_request(job_request)

# Monitor progress
final_status = job.monitor()

# Query research databases
df = client.db.ngl.read_sql("SELECT * FROM SITE LIMIT 10")
```
